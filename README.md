# MSc_Thesis_Metabolic_Modeling
###Repository for Python, MATLAB, and R scripts, along with results from my MSc thesis in Bioinformatics & Computational 
Biology (University College Cork, 2024). This project leverages data science methods for metabolic modeling, PCA, clustering
and pathway analysis, aiming to uncover biological insights from transcriptomic and clinical datasets.
